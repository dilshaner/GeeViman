## 💡 About This Project

GeeViman is **currently under development as a side project** — something I’m building slowly, in between other work, because I love Sinhala music and wanted an offline way to explore lyrics.  
It’s still early, but the goal is to keep it simple, fast, and free.

If you have ideas or feedback, please feel free to share — I’d love to hear them.
